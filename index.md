The DataWorkbench styling is based on the [Bootswatch Flatly colour scheme](https://bootswatch.com/flatly/).

The Flatly scheme is intended for use with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), the front-end component library for websites. It is a library we started using in the DataWorkbench development, and that we have adapted and translated to other tools.

The repository for this Jekyll theme contains stylesheets and configurations for a few other tools too. The purpose is to create a consistent look and feel across texts, diagrams and interfaces.

## This guide

The guide consists of two main parts:

- The [tools section](tools/) contains an overview of the tools and libraries available. This includes information on how to install and use the styling.
- The [guidance section](guidance/) offers an overview of the style itself, and how to it can be used across a documentation workflows.
